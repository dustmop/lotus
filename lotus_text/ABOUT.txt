How to use LotusText library.

----------------------------------------
LotusTextLoadGraphics

Copy nametable and attribute data into the ppu at nametable #0. Must be called
while display is disabled; call takes too much time to run during a single
vblank. After this call, changes to the nametable may be made to add decoration
to the rest of the screen.

----------------------------------------
LotusTextLoadPalette

Assign colors to background palette 0, 1, 2 and sprite palette 0. Other palettes
are unused.

----------------------------------------
LotusTextInit

Initialize state of the LotusText. Must be called before any calls to
LotusTextUpdate.

----------------------------------------
LotusTextUpdate

Call with A set to the current state of the user's controller. Call once per
frame. Updates LotusText's state, and determines which leaves, if any, to
highlight. Uses sprites at $2f8 and $2fc to show selected symbols. After
calling this function, carry flag is set if and only if the user pressed
start button. In this case, A contains the length of the string the user
entered, and the string itself is available starting at address $700.

----------------------------------------
LotusTextDuringVblank

Call during vblank. Applies attribute changes to the ppu in order to highlight
leaves.
